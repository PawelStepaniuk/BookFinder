This book is dedicated to Professor Frank Harary (1921—2005), the grandmaster of graph theory and its applications. It has be written by experts in the field of graph theory and its applications. For a connected graph G, as an important distance-based topological index, the Harary index H(G) is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the distance between any two unordered vertices of the graph G. In this book, the authors report on the newest results on the Harary index of a graph. These results mainly concern external graphs with respect to the Harary index; the relations to other topological indices; its properties and applications to pure graph theory and chemical graph theory; and two significant variants, i.e., additively and multiplicatively weighted Harary indices. In the last chapter, we present a number of open problems related to the Harary index. As such, the book will not only be of interest to graph researchers, but to mathematical chemists as well.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783662458433"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3662458438"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":74,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Mathematics"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.4.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=harary&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":239.01,"currencyCode":"PLN"},"retailPrice":{"amount":167.31,"currencyCode":"PLN"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":239010000,"currencyCode":"PLN"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":167310000,"currencyCode":"PLN"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.pl/books/download/The_Harary_Index_of_a_Graph-sample-epub.acsm?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.pl/books/download/The_Harary_Index_of_a_Graph-sample-pdf.acsm?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=Sr0oBgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This is the first book to focus on the topological index, the Harary index, of a graph, including its mathematical properties, chemical applications and some related and attractive open problems."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"N2tH0U9lxOkC","etag":"r17QxtGOWDk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/N2tH0U9lxOkC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Canadian Mathematical Bulletin","publishedDate":"1974-06","readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":164,"printType":"MAGAZINE","maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.1.2.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2tH0U9lxOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=N2tH0U9lxOkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=N2tH0U9lxOkC&pg=PA208&dq=harary&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=N2tH0U9lxOkC&dq=harary&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Canadian_Mathematical_Bulletin.html?hl=&id=N2tH0U9lxOkC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"ALL_PAGES","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=N2tH0U9lxOkC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"F. <b>Harary</b>, The number of linear, directed, rooted, and connected graphs.

Mezey"],"publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","publishedDate":"1991-01-31","description":"Molecular chirality is one of the fundamental aspects of chemistry. Chirality properties of molecules have implications in a wide variety of subjects, ranging from the basic quantum mechanical properties of simple of a few atoms to molecular optical activity, asymmetric synthesis, systems and the folding pattern of proteins. Chirality, in both the geometrical and the topological sense, has also been the subject of investigations in various branches of mathematics. In particular, new developments in a branch of topology, called knot theory, as well as in various branches of discrete mathematics, have led to a novel perspective on the topological aspects of molecular chirality. Some of the mathematical advances have already found applications to the interpretation of new concepts in theoretical chemistry and mathematical chemistry, as well as to novel synthetic approaches leading to new molecules of exceptional structural properties. Some of the new developments in molecular chirality have been truly fundamental to the theoretical understanding and to the actual practice of many aspects of chemistry. The progress in this field has been very rapid, even accelerating in recent years, and a review appears more than justified. This book offers a selection of subjects covering some of the latest developments. Our primary aim is to clarify some of the basic concepts that are the most prone to misinterpretation and to provide brief introductions to some of those subjects that are expected to have further, important contributions to our understanding of molecular properties and chemical reactivity.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0792310217"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780792310211"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":295,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.1.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&pg=PA256&dq=harary&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&dq=harary&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/New_Developments_in_Molecular_Chirality.html?hl=&id=irAxFfHzJ1kC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"PL","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"PL","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.pl/books/download/New_Developments_in_Molecular_Chirality-sample-pdf.acsm?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=irAxFfHzJ1kC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"1 F. <b>Harary</b> , Typographs .
